A demo program that infers conservation law formulas from numerical measurements using Keplerian orbits as an example. With `REQUIRE_VELOCITY_DEPENDENCE` it converges to the energy conservation, otherwise it converges to the angular momentum conservation. All formulas are printed in the inverse Polish notation.
